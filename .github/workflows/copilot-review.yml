          You are reviewing a pull request for the Contoso University project (React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS).

          Analyze this diff and provide a concise code review covering:
          1. **Summary**: What does this PR do? (2-3 sentences)
          2. **Quality**: Any bugs, type errors, or logic issues?
          3. **Testing**: Are Playwright tests included for UI changes? (tests should be in tests/*.spec.ts)
          4. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions? (TypeScript, Tailwind, functional components)
          5. **Suggestions**: Top 3 specific improvements (if any)

          Keep it concise and actionable. Use emoji for section headers.
